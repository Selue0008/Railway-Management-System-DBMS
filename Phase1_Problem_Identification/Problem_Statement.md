# 🚆 Railway Management System — Problem Identification
**Course:** CONT_24CAP-204 — Database Management System Lab  
**Experiment:** 1.3  
**Outcome:** CO1 — Identify major components in a typical database environment  

---

## 🧠 Domain
**Domain:** Transportation and Ticketing System  
The Railway Management System (RMS) focuses on streamlining train ticket booking, passenger records, and scheduling processes through database automation.

---

## 🏢 Business / Organizational Context
The traditional railway system involves manual ticket booking and decentralized data storage, causing inefficiency, redundancy, and data inconsistency.  
A digital, centralized system can solve these challenges.

## 🚨 Problems Identified
| Problem | Description | Impact |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Manual Ticket Booking | Causes long queues and delays | High |
| Data Redundancy | Duplicate passenger and booking entries | High |
| No Real-Time Updates | Schedules and availability not updated | Medium |
| Inefficient Cancellations | Refunds handled manually | Medium |
| Lack of Centralized Access | Limited data sharing between branches | High |

## 🎯 Scope of Project
The RMS aims to:
- Maintain centralized data on passengers, trains, routes, and bookings.  
- Automate ticket booking, cancellations, and refunds.  
- Enable easy access to real-time train schedules.  
- Provide analytics and reports on daily operations.
